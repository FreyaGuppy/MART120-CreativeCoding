#### What affected you the most?

I was immediately struck by his intro. At the time of this lecture, he had cancer and only a few months left to live. That made the rest of the lecture so much more personal and poignant. At one point later on in the lecture, he likened himself to Moses, saying, "I can see the promised land, but I won't be able to set foot in it." Which is a melancholy sentiment. At the end, he revealed that the lecture was for his kids. Throughout the lecture I got to know him more and more. He seems like such a brilliant, driven, passionate, and genuine person. Learning about this person, knowing he likely died shortly after the lecture made it very meaningful to me. It is tragic that he died so young.

There were other things that affected me too. He seemed to value interpersonal connection and communication greatly. He mentioned that he could tell if his students' project was going to be good by whether or not they seemed comfortable around one another. He realized that you can teach kids hard things by doing it in a fun way. He was told that he is a good salesman and that he might as well be selling something worthwhile, like education. It seems like he really leaned into that throughout his life. He "sold" education to as many people as he could.


#### Did you identify with any of his messages?

There wasn't a ton that I personally identified with from his lecture. Overall we seem to have different interests and life experiences. However, he mentioned valuing honesty and optimism above all else. I also value these things. I think clear and honest communication is crucial in all parts of life, and I try to enjoy as many things as I can. 

This isn't a direct personal connection, but reminded me of a professor I had. The level of passion for his chosen area of study, and his love of teaching reminded me of Mark Reiser, an astronomy professor here at UM.
