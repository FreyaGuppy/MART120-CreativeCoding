## CLI versus GUI

The graphic user interface is what pretty much everyone is used to interacting with while using their computer. It is the visual representation of directories, and files stored in a computer, using windows, menus, symbols, and buttons. GUI allows anyone to quickly learn how to navigate between and organize their files. It mimics physical filing systems that came before digital filing. This makes it easy to understand how and where everything is stored.

The command-line interface however, is a non-visual, strictly text-based system for navigating between directories and files. It is much less intuitive for the average user, however it can be useful to quickly navigate, and give complex commands to your computer if you know how to use it. To use CLI you need to know the specific commands and syntax to find certain directories and files and to understand what it is you are looking at. 

Both interfaces are useful for their own set of circumstances. Whether you should use one or the other comes down to personal preference and knowledge.
